MeshViewer by Matt Schoen - Defective Studios

1. Open Window -> MeshViewer
2. Drop a GameObject from the scene or project view with a MeshFilter, SkinnedMeshRenderer, or MeshCollider component into the GameObject field in the upper right of the MeshViewer window

Checking "Show Vertices", "Show Normals", etc. will display columns with the selected information.  If an option is missing, that data is missing from the mesh.

Checking "Link scroll bars" will scroll all vertex-based information (Vertices, Normals, Tangents, UV/2s, and Colors) at the same time.

The "Mesh Topology" slider will display the current topology type, and changing the value will change the actual mesh topology.
